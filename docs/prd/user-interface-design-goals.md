# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The vision is a frictionless, "scan-and-submit" experience for employees and a clear, uncluttered dashboard for managers. The design will prioritize speed and clarity above all else, requiring minimal user thought to complete core tasks.

## Core Screens and Views
1.  **Time-Off Request Form (Public):** The single page an employee sees after scanning the QR code.
2.  **Manager Request Dashboard (Private):** The secure page where a manager logs in to view their list of submitted requests.

## Branding
* **Primary Logo:** The **Product Connections** logo will be the primary brand identifier.
* **Affiliated Logo:** The **Crossmark** logo should be included in a subordinate role, such as in the footer with the text "A Crossmark Agency."
* **Color Palette:** The core color scheme will be based on the Product Connections logo, featuring its distinctive dark and light blues.
