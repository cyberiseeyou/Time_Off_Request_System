# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* **Standardize the Process:** Achieve 95% adoption of the new system for all time-off requests across the company within 3 months of launch.
* **Increase Operational Efficiency:** Reduce the administrative time managers spend collecting and tracking time-off requests by at least 50%.
* **Eliminate Routing Errors:** Reduce the rate of misdirected or lost time-off requests to zero.

## Background Context
The company currently lacks a standardized method for handling employee time-off requests, relying on a mix of inconsistent channels like email, text, and paper forms. This creates inefficiency for managers, a frustrating experience for employees, and introduces a high risk of errors such as lost or misrouted requests. This PRD outlines the requirements for a centralized, QR-code-based system designed to solve these problems by creating a single, simple, and reliable workflow.
