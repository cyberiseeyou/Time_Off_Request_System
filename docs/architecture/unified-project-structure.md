# Unified Project Structure

A monorepo will be used with the following structure:
* `apps/web/`: The existing Next.js frontend.
* `apps/api/`: The new Python FastAPI backend.
* `packages/shared-types/`: For shared TypeScript data models.
* `docker-compose.yml`: To run the entire application stack.
