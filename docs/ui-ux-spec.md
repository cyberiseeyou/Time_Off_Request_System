## Overall UX Goals & Principles

* **Target User Personas:** Employees (requiring speed and simplicity) and Scheduling Managers (requiring clarity and efficiency).

## Information Architecture (IA)

The application has two distinct areas: a public form for employees and a secure portal for managers. Navigation is minimal by design.

    end

    subgraph Secure Manager Portal
        B["Login Page"] --> C["Request Dashboard"]
    end

    A -- Submits Data To --> C

## User Flows

* **Employee Request Submission:** The user scans a QR code, fills out the form, and receives a success message. The flow includes validation for required fields and correct date ranges.
* **Manager Views Requests:** The manager navigates to a private URL, logs in, and views a dashboard containing a list of their team's requests.

## Wireframes & Mockups

* **Request Form:** A mobile-first, single-column form containing a header, manager's name, and input fields for "Full Name," "Start Date," "End Date," and "Reason," with a prominent "Submit" button.
* **Manager Dashboard:** A simple page with a header, a "Logout" button, and a table displaying requests with columns for "Employee Name," "Dates Requested," "Reason," and "Submitted On."

## Branding & Style Guide

* **Visual Identity:** The **Product Connections** logo is primary, with the **Crossmark** logo used in the footer to show affiliation.
* **Color Palette:** The primary colors are dark blue (`#1a3a6b`) and accent blue (`#007dc5`), supplemented by standard colors for success, warning, and error states.
* **Typography:** The font family will be **"Inter"** for its clean, professional look.
* **Spacing:** A standard **8-point grid system** will be used for consistent spacing.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness

* **Accessibility:** The application will be built to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards, ensuring usability for people with disabilities.
* **Responsiveness:** A **mobile-first** approach will be used, with the layout adapting gracefully to tablet and desktop screen sizes.
