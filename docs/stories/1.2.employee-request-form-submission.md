# Story 1.2: Employee Request Form & Submission

## Status
Done

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- ‚úÖ Database foundation ready: `managers` and `time_off_requests` tables exist
- ‚úÖ n8n workflow system configured for initial MVP implementation
- ‚úÖ SQLite database with proper schema and foreign key constraints
- üîß **Critical:** Manager-to-request relationship via `manager_id` foreign key established
- üìÅ **Foundation files available:** `docker-compose.yml`, database scripts ready

### Data Models
**Database Schema Requirements:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- **`time_off_requests` Table:** Stores `id`, `employee_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`, and a `manager_id` foreign key
- **`managers` Table:** Contains `id`, `name`, `email`, and secure `password_hash`

**Shared Types:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- TypeScript interfaces must be defined in `packages/shared-types` for use by both frontend and backend
- Data structures must align with existing database schema

### API Specifications
**Public Endpoint for Form Submission:** [Source: architecture/api-specification-openapi-30.md]
- **`POST /requests`:** Public endpoint to submit a new time-off request
- Must handle employee_name, start_date, end_date, reason, and manager_id association

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for UI components.

### File Locations
**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Frontend:** `apps/web/` - Next.js application for the public form
- **Shared Types:** `packages/shared-types/` - TypeScript interfaces for data models
- **API Integration:** Form will call existing `POST /requests` endpoint

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- **Frontend Testing:** React Testing Library for unit tests
- **Testing Pyramid:** Foundation of unit tests with small number of E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright)
- **Performance Testing:** Verify mobile loading under 3 seconds requirement

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.16 with TypeScript ^5
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ^4.1.9 for mobile-responsive design
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL 8.x integration with existing schema

**Functional Requirements:** [Source: prd/requirements.md]
- **FR2:** QR code must direct to web-based time-off request form
- **FR3:** Form must collect employee name, start/end dates, optional reason
- **FR4:** Data must be saved and associated with correct manager

**Non-Functional Requirements:** [Source: prd/requirements.md]
- **NFR1:** Mobile-responsive and load under 3 seconds on mobile networks
- **NFR2:** MVP must use self-hosted n8n workflow integration
- **NFR3:** Secure data transmission and storage required

### Project Structure Notes
**Alignment Check:**
- Epic requirement aligns with existing API endpoint `POST /requests`
- Form submission integrates with established database schema from Story 1.1
- Next.js frontend structure fits within `apps/web/` monorepo organization
- QR code parameter handling aligns with manager ID foreign key relationship

## Testing
**Testing Standards:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- **Test Framework:** React Testing Library for frontend component testing
- **Test Location:** Follow Testing Pyramid approach with unit test foundation
- **Performance Testing:** Verify mobile loading time requirements (NFR1)
- **Security Testing:** Validate secure data transmission (NFR3)
- **Specific Requirements:** Test form validation, QR parameter parsing, and API integration
