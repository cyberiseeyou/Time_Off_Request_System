## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- ‚úÖ Database foundation ready with `managers` and `time_off_requests` tables
- ‚úÖ API structure established with proper TypeScript interfaces
- ‚úÖ Public form working and creating requests with `manager_id` associations
- üîß **Critical:** Request-to-manager relationship via `manager_id` foreign key established
- üìÅ **Foundation files available:** Shared types package, API structure ready

### Data Models
**Database Schema Requirements:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- **`managers` Table:** Stores `id`, `name`, `email`, and a secure `password_hash`
- **`time_off_requests` Table:** Stores `id`, `employee_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`, and a `manager_id` foreign key

**Shared Types:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- TypeScript interfaces defined in `packages/shared-types` for use by both frontend and backend
- Manager and request data structures must align with existing database schema

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints:** [Source: architecture/api-specification-openapi-30.md]
- **`POST /manager/login`:** Secure endpoint for managers to authenticate
- **`GET /manager/requests`:** Secure, cookie-protected endpoint for authenticated manager to retrieve their list of requests

**Security Requirements:**
- Cookie-based session management for authenticated state
- Password hash validation against stored `password_hash`
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for UI components.

### File Locations
**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Frontend:** `apps/web/` - Next.js application for manager portal
- **API Backend:** `apps/api/` - Python FastAPI backend (future migration)
- **Shared Types:** `packages/shared-types/` - TypeScript interfaces for data models

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- **Frontend Testing:** React Testing Library for unit tests
- **Backend Testing:** pytest for backend API testing

- **Security Testing:** Verify authentication flows and session management

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.16 with TypeScript ^5
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ^4.1.9 for responsive design
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL 8.x with existing schema
- **Backend:** Currently Next.js API routes (future FastAPI migration planned)

**Security Requirements:**
- Secure password hashing and verification
- Session-based authentication with cookies
- CSRF protection for forms
- HTTPS for secure data transmission

### Project Structure Notes
**Alignment Check:**
- Manager authentication aligns with existing `managers` table schema
- Request retrieval leverages established `manager_id` foreign key relationship
- API endpoints follow existing pattern from Story 1.2 implementation
- Frontend fits within `apps/web/` Next.js structure established in previous stories

## Testing
**Testing Standards:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- **Test Framework:** React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend
- **Test Location:** Follow Testing Pyramid approach with unit test foundation
- **Security Testing:** Validate authentication flows and session security
- **Performance Testing:** Verify portal loading time requirements (AC5)
- **Specific Requirements:** Test login flows, request display, and secure session handling

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall implementation quality is **good** with well-structured React components, proper TypeScript usage, and comprehensive error handling. The authentication flow is correctly implemented with session-based management. UI components follow modern patterns with responsive design and good user experience considerations.

### Refactoring Performed

**Critical Security Fixes Applied:**

- **File**: `app/api/manager/login/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced weak password verification with timing-attack resistant implementation
  - **Why**: Prevent timing attacks that could reveal password information
  - **How**: Implemented constant-time buffer comparison instead of simple string equality

- **File**: `app/api/manager/login/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced Math.random() with crypto.randomBytes() for session tokens
  - **Why**: Math.random() is cryptographically weak and predictable
  - **How**: Used Node.js crypto module for cryptographically secure random generation

- **File**: `app/api/manager/me/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Created new endpoint for proper session validation
  - **Why**: Improve separation of concerns and eliminate hardcoded user data
  - **How**: Dedicated endpoint that returns authenticated manager info from session

- **File**: `lib/auth/useAuth.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated to use new /api/manager/me endpoint for authentication checks
  - **Why**: Remove hardcoded mock data and improve session validation
  - **How**: Proper API call to get real session data instead of static values

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ‚úì TypeScript usage, proper error handling, React patterns followed
- **Project Structure**: ‚úì Files organized correctly in app/, lib/, components/ directories
