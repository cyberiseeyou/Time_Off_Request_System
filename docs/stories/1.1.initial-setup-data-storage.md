## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models
**Database Schema Requirements:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- **`managers` Table:** Stores `id`, `name`, `email`, and a secure `password_hash`
- **`time_off_requests` Table:** Stores `id`, `employee_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`, and a `manager_id` foreign key

**Shared Types:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- Shared data structures will be defined in TypeScript interfaces in `packages/shared-types` for use by both frontend and backend

### API Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this setup story.

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this setup story.

### File Locations
**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Monorepo structure with `apps/web/`, `apps/api/`, `packages/shared-types/`
- `docker-compose.yml` at root for running entire application stack

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- Foundation of unit tests (pytest for backend)
- End-to-end tests using Cypress/Playwright
- Testing Pyramid approach

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Database: SQLite / MySQL 8.x for data storage
- Deployment: Docker (latest) for containerization

**Technical Assumptions:** [Source: prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- MVP implementation uses self-hosted n8n instance
- Database: SQLite for MVP, with migration path to MySQL
- Repository Structure: Monorepo recommended

**Non-Functional Requirements:** [Source: prd/requirements.md]
- NFR2: MVP application must be built using self-hosted n8n workflow
- NFR3: All employee data must be securely transmitted and stored
- NFR4: Manager's portal must be protected by secure authentication mechanism

### Project Structure Notes
**Alignment Check:**
- Epic requirement for n8n workflow aligns with NFR2 requirement
- Database schema aligns with defined data models
- Setup is foundational for later custom application development in `apps/api/`

## Testing
**Testing Standards:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- **Test Framework:** pytest for backend testing
- **Test Location:** Follow Testing Pyramid approach
- **Testing Requirements:** Unit tests for database operations and n8n workflow validation
- **Specific Requirements:** Test database connectivity, table creation, and basic CRUD operations

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent foundational implementation** - This story delivers a robust, production-ready database and workflow infrastructure. The implementation demonstrates strong engineering practices with comprehensive testing, clear documentation, and security considerations. All code is clean, well-documented, and follows industry best practices for database design and container orchestration.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - the code quality meets high standards out of the box.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean Python code with proper error handling and documentation
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows unified monorepo structure (apps/, packages/, docker-compose.yml)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive testing suite using pytest approach
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

All items completed - no improvements needed:

- [x] SQLite database created with proper schema and constraints (database/create_sqlite_db.py)
- [x] Comprehensive CRUD testing implemented (database/test_connection.py)
- [x] n8n workflow configured with error handling (n8n/workflows/time-off-workflow.json)

- [x] Complete setup documentation provided (docs/SETUP.md)
- [x] Sample data and testing scenarios included
- [x] Foreign key constraints properly enforced
- [x] Password hashing implemented securely

### Security Review

**PASS** - Security measures properly implemented:
- ✓ Password hashing using secure bcrypt algorithm
- ✓ Foreign key constraints enforced for data integrity
- ✓ Basic authentication configured for n8n (though default credentials noted for production change)
- ✓ Database permissions properly configured
- ✓ No credentials hardcoded in application code

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Performance optimizations included:
- ✓ Database indexes created on critical columns (manager_id, dates, email)
- ✓ Efficient SQLite configuration with foreign key constraints
- ✓ Docker container resource allocation appropriate for MVP
- ✓ Clear migration path documented for MySQL production scaling

### Files Modified During Review
