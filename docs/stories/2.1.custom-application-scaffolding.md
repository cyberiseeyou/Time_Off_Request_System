## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion:
- ‚úÖ **Existing Database Schema:** `managers` and `time_off_requests` tables already established and working
- ‚úÖ **Current Stack:** Next.js frontend with API routes handling authentication and data retrieval
- ‚úÖ **Shared Types:** TypeScript interfaces defined in `packages/shared-types` ready for reuse
- üîß **Migration Context:** Moving from Next.js API routes to dedicated Python FastAPI backend
- üìÅ **Foundation Ready:** Database structure, authentication patterns, and data models established

### Data Models
**Database Schema (Existing):** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- **`managers` Table:** Stores `id`, `name`, `email`, and secure `password_hash`
- **`time_off_requests` Table:** Stores `id`, `employee_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `reason`, and `manager_id` foreign key

**Shared Types Integration:** [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]
- TypeScript interfaces defined in `packages/shared-types` for frontend/backend consistency
- Python models should align with existing TypeScript interfaces where possible

### API Specifications
**Core Endpoints to Implement:** [Source: architecture/api-specification-openapi-30.md]
- **`POST /requests`:** Public endpoint for time-off request submission
- **`POST /manager/login`:** Secure manager authentication endpoint
- **`GET /manager/requests`:** Protected endpoint for manager request retrieval
- **Health Check:** `/health` endpoint for application monitoring

**Initial Focus:** Health check endpoint only for Story 2.1, other endpoints in subsequent stories

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for FastAPI components.

### File Locations
**Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Backend API:** `apps/api/` - New Python FastAPI backend application
- **Frontend:** `apps/web/` - Existing Next.js frontend (unchanged in this story)
- **Shared Types:** `packages/shared-types/` - TypeScript interfaces for data models
- **Docker:** `docker-compose.yml` at project root for full stack orchestration

**FastAPI Structure (Standard):**
- `apps/api/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `apps/api/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `apps/api/Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `apps/api/models/` - Database models (future use)
- `apps/api/routes/` - API route handlers (future use)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/deployment-development.md]
- **Backend Testing:** pytest for Python FastAPI backend testing
- **Test Structure:** Testing Pyramid approach with unit test foundation
- **Location:** Standard Python test structure within `apps/api/`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** The FastAPI application structure is well-implemented with proper separation of concerns, good error handling, and solid containerization. However, critical issues prevent production readiness.

**Strengths:**
- Clean FastAPI application structure with proper CORS configuration
- Well-designed SQLAlchemy models that align with existing database schema
- Proper Docker containerization with security best practices (non-root user)
- Good health check implementation with database connectivity testing
- Proper environment variable handling with fallbacks

### Critical Issues Found

**üö® FAIL-LEVEL ISSUES:**

1. **No Tests Implemented** - Story requires pytest testing but no test files exist
2. **Incorrect Database Path** - SQLite path `../../database/time_off_system.db` will fail in Docker container
3. **Docker Build Context Mismatch** - Dockerfile assumes project root build context but copies from wrong location

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNS-LEVEL ISSUES:**

4. **Missing Test Dependencies** - pytest not included in requirements.txt
5. **Hardcoded CORS Origins** - Should use environment variables for flexibility
6. **Database Connection Error Handling** - SQLAlchemy errors not properly caught

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/api/database.py`
  - **Change**: Fixed SQLite database path from `../../database/time_off_system.db` to `./database/time_off_system.db`
  - **Why**: The relative path was incorrect for Docker container execution
  - **How**: Updated DATABASE_URL default to use correct relative path from container working directory

- **File**: `apps/api/requirements.txt`
  - **Change**: Added pytest==7.4.3 and httpx==0.25.2
  - **Why**: Testing requirements were missing despite story requiring tests
  - **How**: Added testing dependencies needed for FastAPI testing

- **File**: `apps/api/main.py`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling and made CORS origins configurable
  - **Why**: Better production readiness and environment flexibility
  - **How**: Added environment variable for CORS origins with sensible default

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ‚ö†Ô∏è No formal coding standards document found
- **Project Structure**: ‚úì Follows unified monorepo structure perfectly
